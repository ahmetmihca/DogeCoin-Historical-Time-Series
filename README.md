# DogeCoin-Historical-Time-Series
The Dataset The dataset choice is Dogecoin Historical Time Series from Dogecoin Historical Data | Kaggle. Also, it is planning to collect data about the value of ETH (Ethereum) and BTC (Bitcoin) from Ethereum Data | Kaggle and Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) Price, News, Quote &amp; History - Yahoo Finance. Additionally, Elon Musk’s tweets about altcoins are going to get from Elon Musk Tweets (2010 - 2021) | Kaggle.   The Objective of the Project The main problem we are trying to solve in this project is what factors affect the value of Dogecoin. In accordance with this purpose, the values of Bitcoin and Ethereum are going to be examined with the value of Dogecoin to figure out whether there is any correlation between them. Also, Elon Musk’s tweets could play an essential role in the value of Dogecoin. In other words, when Musk tweets about Dogecoin, we are going to analyze the change in the value of Dogecoin. According to the results, we would need to decide how much Musk can be so important in the popularity of Dogecoin. Another problem in this project is making predictions for the value of Dogecoin. To achieve this, regression analysis is required on the given historical data.
